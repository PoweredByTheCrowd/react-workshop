        <H2>Assignment</H2>
        <p> This is where you continue. We ask you to create a page in where you can see the details of
          a character. Also show a list of films in which the character appears. You can find this page in
            containers/CharacterPage. The relevant REST resources
            are <A href="http://swapi.co/documentation#people">/people</A> and <A href="http://swapi.co/documentation#films">/films</A>.<br/>
          In the images folder we have provided an example of how the page could look.
          <br/>
          For inspiration on how to start you can take a look at the StarWarsPage in the components directory.
        </p>
        <H2>Bootstrap</H2>
        <p>This project uses bootstrap (v3) so you can style your components easily.
          Take a look at <A href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/">the bootstrap website</A> to learn more.</p>
        <H2>Bonus</H2>
        <p>
          If you are looking for something extra to do you can add error handling to the Star Wars Page. If something
          goes wrong when calling the API the user gets no feedback. It would be nice to notify the user that something
          went wrong.
          <br/>
          Also there is no pagination on the search page. The API gives you the first 10 results and also tells you how
          many result there are. Good luck!
